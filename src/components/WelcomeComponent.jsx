                            Situated in the wilderness is a fortified keep, sitting atop a natural flat-top hill. The keep is a bastion of good people, eking out an existence in the untamed wildes. Thick stone walls patrolled by able-bodied men-at-arms provide protection to a thriving community. Roving bands of bloodthirsty humanoids, ravenous wild beasts, and vile brigands are but a few of the constant threats that face the inhabitants of the keep. Even from beneath the very foundation of the keep do the forces of evil oppose the good folk residing within.

                            Garan was a simple man, the proprietor of a small provision shop located in the wilderness keep. He sold all manner of mundane items such as cookery and building supplies, and adventuring equipment such as rope, flasks of oil, and backpacks. Although a few spears and long knives are for sale in the shop, Garan sent those seeking arms and armor to a nearby blacksmith. His prices where fair, and he was always interested in tales from beyond the wall, or was quick to offer his pessimistic view on the local leadership. Garan lived alone in a small apartment at the back of his shop untill today.
